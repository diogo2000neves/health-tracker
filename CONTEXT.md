# Health Tracker — System Context

> Paste this into a new chat as background before asking for new features.
> No secrets are included here; all live in Google Secret Manager.

## 1. Goal & philosophy

A **zero-friction personal health dashboard**. The golden rule: I only perform the
inevitable physical actions of my day (step on the scale, wear my tracker, snap a
photo of what I eat). *Everything else* — collection, extraction, organisation —
is automated background work. If I have to open apps, type data, or export
reports, the system has failed.

The end goal is to **correlate nutrition against physique on a per-day basis**:
what I ate vs what my body did.

Constraints: 100% cloud (no laptop needed), near-zero ongoing cost, simple enough
for an AI agent to maintain, and **sovereign storage** — final data lives in a
Google Sheet + Google Drive that I own and can download anytime.

## 2. The three data sources

| # | Source | Hardware / input | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Body composition** | Tefal **Goodvibes** smart scale | ✅ Built (weight + body-fat only) |
| 2 | **Biometrics / activity** | **Fitbit Air** (steps, sleep, HR) | ❌ **NOT built yet** |
| 3 | **Nutrition** | iPhone camera → meal photos | ✅ Built |

### Source 1 — Scale (weight, body fat)
Scale → Goodvibes app → Fitbit cloud → **Google Health**. A daily Cloud Run **Job**
pulls it via the **Google Health API** and writes one row per day.

**Hard limitation (already researched, don't redo):** the scale measures ~14
metrics (visceral fat, body water, muscle/bone mass, BMR, metabolic age…), but
**only weight, body-fat and height survive** the trip to Google Health — Fitbit
strips the rest. The Google Health API exposes *only* the data types `weight`,
`body-fat`, `height`. The rich metrics are computed on-device from bioimpedance
and exist only inside the Goodvibes app (no public API). The only way to capture
them would be reading the scale's **Bluetooth** signal directly with an always-on
device (e.g. `ble-scale-sync` on a Raspberry Pi). **Decision: not doing it.** We
deliberately keep just **weight + body_fat_pct**.

### Source 2 — Fitbit Air (NOT built)
This is the next obvious feature. It should reuse the *same* Google Health API and
the *same* OAuth token — just different `dataTypes` (steps, sleep, heart rate) and
extra scopes (`activity_and_fitness.readonly`, `sleep.readonly`). Unlike the
scale's body composition, this biometric data **is** fully available via the API.

### Source 3 — Meal photos
iPhone **Shortcut** (a button in Control Center) → takes a photo → HTTP **POST**s
it straight to a Cloud Run **service**. That service archives the photo to Google
Drive, sends it to **Gemini** for nutrition estimation, and appends a row to the
Sheet. Photos never touch iCloud or Google Photos (neither is readable by a
server — the Google Photos API can no longer read a user's library, and iCloud has
no server API at all).

An **optional free-text `note`** can ride along (multipart form field, `?note=`
query, or JSON). With a photo it's **authoritative** context that overrides the
visual estimate ("only ate half" → halves portions; "air-fried, no oil" → drops
the hidden-fat guess). A note with **no photo** is a **text-only meal** — Gemini
estimates from the description alone at **capped confidence (≤0.50)**, nothing is
archived to Drive, and the raw note is stored in `meals.note` for provenance.

## 3. Architecture

```
              ┌────────────────── Google Sheet "Health Tracker" ──────────────────┐
              │ `daily_summary` : one row/day (readiness + nutrition + physique)  │
              │ `meals`         : one row/photo (per-ingredient `items` JSON)     │
              │ `dashboard`     : stat cells + embedded charts                    │
              │ `insights`      : weekly AI trend summaries                       │
              └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                     ▲                    ▲                       ▲
  Cloud Scheduler    │   Cloud Scheduler  │                       │
  (07:00 Lisbon) ─► JOB   (Sun 20:00) ─► JOB              SERVICE ◄── iPhone Shortcut
       health-tracker-daily   health-tracker-weekly   health-tracker-ingest
               │                      │                    │  │      (POST /ingest photo,
       Google Health API         Gemini API        Gemini API │       POST /feel score)
       (weight, body-fat)        (insights)       (nutrition) │
                                                       Google Drive (photo archive)
```

- **Job vs Service:** Jobs are *pulls* on a timer (scale data; weekly analysis).
  The Service is a *push* endpoint that waits for the phone. All scale to zero.
- **CI/CD:** pushing to `main` on GitHub runs `cloudbuild.yaml` — unit tests
  gate the build, then all three targets are rebuilt and redeployed (images
  tagged with the commit SHA; env vars/secrets preserved). Trigger:
  `health-tracker-deploy` (europe-west1).
- **Day grain:** every `date` is the **local civil day** (Europe/Lisbon / the
  device's own utcOffset) — never the UTC day.
- Everything lives in GCP project **`health-tracker-501322`**, region
  **`europe-west1`**. Log-based alert policies email on any job error, ingest
  error, or failed build.

## 4. Auth model (three identities, least-privilege)

| What | Identity | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Read Google Health API | **User OAuth token** | health data requires *user* consent; a service account can't read it |
| Write the Sheet | **Service account** | the Sheet is shared with it as Editor |
| Upload photos to Drive | **User OAuth token** (`drive.file`) | ⚠️ a service account has **zero Drive storage quota** — uploads must run as the user to use their 5 TB |
| Call Gemini | **API key** | free tier |

Service account: `health-tracker-job@health-tracker-501322.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
(has no project-level roles; only resource-level secret access + run.invoker).

## 5. Key resources

| Thing | Value |
|---|---|
| GCP project | `health-tracker-501322` (billing enabled) |
| Cloud Run Job | `health-tracker-daily` (europe-west1) |
| Cloud Run Service | `health-tracker-ingest` (europe-west1, public URL, gated by `X-Auth-Token` header) |
| Scheduler | `health-tracker-daily-trigger` — `0 7 * * *` Europe/Lisbon |
| Sheet ID | `1JQWYkSgzU3F4mqR7BRE8wfoBif0xLU7uBM0iwHwxNAk` |
| Drive photo folder | `1i0wYuIzcD7ifs_wVQVdsUpI26vGmJdfP` ("Health Tracker Meals", owned by user) |
| Secrets (Secret Manager) | `health-oauth-token`, `ingest-token`, `gemini-api-key` |
| Code (master copy) | `/Users/dneves/Health Tracker/` — `src/` (job), `ingest/` (service) |

### Sheet schema
- **`daily_summary`**: `date` | readiness (`sleep_score, hrv_ms, spo2_pct,
  skin_temp_dev, subjective_feel`) | macros (`total_cals_in, total_protein_g,
  total_carbs_g, total_fat_g`) | **15 Tier-1 micronutrient totals**
  (`total_fiber_g, total_sugar_g, total_saturated_fat_g, total_sodium_mg,
  total_potassium_mg, total_calcium_mg, total_iron_mg, total_magnesium_mg,
  total_zinc_mg, total_vitamin_c_mg, total_vitamin_d_ug, total_vitamin_b12_ug,
  total_vitamin_a_ug, total_folate_ug, total_omega3_g`) | activity
  (`total_active_mins, steps`) | body (`weight_kg, body_fat_pct, lean_mass_kg`) |
  `updated_at`. Column order lives in `src.sheets.DAILY_HEADERS`.
  - **Merge-upsert keyed on `date`** — each source fills only its own columns
    (scale → physique, meals roll-up → nutrition, /feel → subjective_feel;
    Fitbit biometrics will fill the readiness block). Never overwrites a column
    it doesn't own.
  - Multiple weigh-ins/day → the **first of the local day** wins;
    `lean_mass_kg = weight_kg × (1 − body_fat_pct/100)` is derived by the job.
  - The daily job re-rolls a trailing `HEALTH_RECONCILE_DAYS` (7) window; set 0
    + `HEALTH_START_DATE=2000-01-01` for a full backfill run.
- **`meals`**: `datetime | foods | items | calories | protein_g | carbs_g | fat_g |
  confidence | model | photo_url | portion_g | image_sha | note`
  - `note` = the user's optional free-text description (empty for most rows);
    stored for provenance, especially for text-only meals (empty `photo_url`).
  - `items` = JSON array, one object per ingredient with its portion, macros,
    `cooking_method` and a `nutrients` map (~36 possible nutrients, only the
    non-negligible ones stored). The flat columns are the row totals; the daily
    job sums the Tier-1 nutrients from `items` into `daily_summary`.
  - `confidence` uses a fixed 0.1–1.0 rubric (model-independent); `model` records
    which AI analysed the photo (audit); `image_sha` de-duplicates double-taps.
  - Rows with foods `not food` / `analysis failed` (or all-zero macros) are
    excluded from every roll-up.
- **Schema changes**: add the column to `DAILY_HEADERS` and run
  `python -m src.maintenance` (inserts the column in place so history stays
  aligned). Never reorder or rename existing columns.

## 6. Gemini setup (important cost nuances)

- Uses the **Gemini Developer API** (AI Studio key), **not** Vertex AI.
- ⚠️ **Google AI Pro subscription does NOT grant API access.** It only provides the
  Gemini app + 5 TB storage.
- ⚠️ An AI Studio key on a project **with billing enabled silently uses the PAID
  tier**. So the key lives in the **billing-free** project
  `gen-lang-client-0757945342`. This is what makes it **€0**.
- Free tier ≈ 1,500 requests/day, **Flash models only**. Google may use free-tier
  data to improve their products (accepted).
- **Model fallback chain** (`GEMINI_MODELS` env):
  `gemini-3.1-flash-lite → gemini-3.5-flash → gemini-3-flash-preview`.
  flash-lite goes **first** deliberately: the bigger Flash models 503 on most
  free-tier calls (10–40 s of wasted fallback latency), and a *consistent*
  estimator produces cleaner day-to-day trend deltas than a mix of models with
  different biases. If every model fails, the photo is archived and an
  `analysis failed` stub row is logged — a meal is never silently lost.
- Output is enforced with a typed `response_schema` (structured JSON), not
  prompt-format begging, with a `reasoning` field generated FIRST so the model
  works through scale and hidden fats before committing to numbers — that
  ordering is the main accuracy lever. The prompt forces: opportunistic scale
  calibration (use whatever reference is actually in frame, apply typical sizes
  only when sure, lower confidence when none exists), a dedicated hidden-fats
  step (absorbed cooking oil, sauces, added sugar — the biggest calorie-error
  source), per-ingredient breakdown with cooking method, weight from size +
  density including occluded food, and a per-item kcal ≈ 4P + 4C + 9F check.
  Meal totals are summed in code from the items, never by the model (avoids
  arithmetic errors).

## 7. Cost

Effectively **~€0.10/month** (container storage). Cloud Run / Scheduler / Secret
Manager are within free tiers; Gemini is free tier; photos use the user's own 5 TB
Google One storage (from AI Pro).

## 8. Gotchas learned (don't rediscover these)

1. Legacy **Fitbit Web API dies Sept 2026**; Google Fit REST dies end-2026. Use the
   **Google Health API** (`https://health.googleapis.com/v4`).
2. Google Health response shape is **nested**: `dataPoints[].weight.weightGrams`,
   `.weight.sampleTime.physicalTime` (UTC); body-fat is `.bodyFat.percentage`.
3. OAuth app must be **In production** (not "Testing"), or refresh tokens expire
   after 7 days.
4. Cloud Build fails until the **default compute SA** gets `roles/cloudbuild.builds.builder`.
5. `gcloud --set-env-vars` **breaks on commas inside a value** — use the delimiter
   syntax: `--set-env-vars "^@^VAR=a,b@VAR2=c"`.
6. Service accounts have **no Drive storage quota** → Drive uploads must use the
   user's OAuth token.
7. **Google Photos API cannot read your library** (since Mar 2025) and **iCloud has
   no server API** — that's why photos are POSTed directly to our endpoint.
8. **The Google Health API rejects any token that also carries a Drive scope**
   (`403 DISALLOWED_OAUTH_SCOPES`). The daily job is pinned to
   `health-oauth-token:1` (health-only); ingest uses `latest` (health+drive).
   One combined token can never serve both APIs.
9. The sheet's **European locale renders decimals with commas** — every Sheets
   read must use `valueRenderOption="UNFORMATTED_VALUE"`, or `float("7,8")`
   silently zeroes the numbers. Avoid locale-sensitive formulas; charts and
   stats are written via the API instead.
10. A reading's day is its **local civil day** (`civilTime`/`utcOffset` from the
    Health API), matching the Lisbon-local `datetime` in `meals`. Never `[:10]`
    a UTC timestamp to get the day.

## 9. Open TODOs

1. **Fitbit Air biometrics** (steps, sleep stages, HRV, SpO2, resting HR) —
   same Google Health API, new dataTypes + extra scopes
   (`activity_and_fitness.readonly`, `sleep.readonly`). Requires a re-consent,
   which is also the moment to do #2:
2. **Token split** — mint a health-only token (with the new scopes) for the
   jobs and a separate `drive.file`-only token (new secret `drive-oauth-token`)
   for ingest; unpin the job from `health-oauth-token:1`; rotate the OAuth
   **client secret** (it was once pasted in chat).
3. Optional: mirror raw Health API payloads to a GCS bucket (bronze layer) for
   provenance / re-derivation.
